# Steganography Desktop App

## ‚ùó Important notes:
- This app's main purpose wasn't *steganography*, rather than just learning more about the process of creating a desktop application.
- Supports  _jpg_  and  _png_  files.
- I plan on making only a few more minor changes.
<br>

## Used packages (that aren't built-in)
- [CustomTkinter](https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/) 5.2.0+
- [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) 8.2.0+
<br>

## Steganography technique
- For this project I chose to simply hide the given message, or data, in the image's **hex dump**, so there's no pixel/palette processing.

- We only have to append the binary data to the image file.
  - This would be the equialent command in a command line to hide a message:
<br>

  ``` cmd
  $ echo "this is a secret message" >> image.jpg
  ```
