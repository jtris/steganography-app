# Steganography Desktop App

## ‚ùó Important notes:
- This app's main purpose wasn't originally *steganography*, rather than just learning more about the process of creating a desktop application. The app is built in a way so that it's hopefully easily expansible, in case I wanted to make changes to it in the future.
- Supports  _jpg_  and  _png_  files.
- I plan on adding more functionalities to this program, mainly the ability to choose the encryption technique.

## Steganography technique
- For this project I chose to simply hide the given message, or data, in the image's **hex dump**, so there's no pixel/palette processing.

- We only have to append the binary data to the image file.
  - This would be the equialent command in a command line to hide a message:
<br>

  ``` cmd
  $ echo "this is a secret message" >> image.jpg
  ```
